## The idea

I want to build an App that allows users discover/study astronomy in an interactive and modern way. 
The purpose of this app is to provide free and fun tool for students and enthusiasts.

the app must be fast, cool, animated and with a modern and intuitive design. I will also develop the mopile version in the future.

the app will feature:

 -a gallery with the picture of the day captured by NASA and previous pictures with user being able to search pictures by date and view specific informations.
 -details about planets and objects in the solar system.
 -visual rappresentation of the solar system
 - planets cards with weather information of each planet
 - a Quiz page
 -latest news

 the app will not feature too many things in the beginning.
